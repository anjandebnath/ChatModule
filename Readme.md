### DI core principal
The core principal of dependency injection is `A class shouldnâ€™t know anything about how it is injected.`

- Each project should contain an Application class.
- Application class build a graph using **AppComponent**.


-  AppComponent has **@Component** annotation top of its class. 
-  When AppComponent is build with its **modules**, we have a graph with all *provided instances* in our graph.
-  For instance, If **AppModule** provides ApiService, we will have ApiService instance when we build component which has app module.

#### Attach Activity to Dagger

If we want to attach our **activity** to dagger graph to get instances from ancestor, we simply create a **@Subcomponent** for it.
Then, last step we have to take, we need to tell ancestor about subcomponent info. So all subcomponents have to be known by its ancestor.
